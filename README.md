Neural Collaborative Filtering for Expert Recommendation in Stack Overflow

The final paper is available [here](https://github.com/Minam7/NeuMF_SO/blob/master/Final%20Report/DL_Project_Report.pdf).

In community question and answer (CQA) platforms, such as Stack Overflow(SO), recommending relevant experts for answering questions is crucial. Personalized recommendation models users’ preference for items based on their past interactions, known as Collaborative filtering(CF). The most popular collaborative filtering technique is matrix factorization (MF), which utilizes a vector of latent features to represent a user or an item that can model user’s interaction on an item as the inner product of their latent vectors. In this paper, I implemented a neural network recommender(NCF)\cite{10.1145/3038912.3052569} based on implicit feedback to suggest experts in CQA platforms. This approach combines traditional matrix factorization and multi-layer perceptron to perform the recommendation, which generalizes the MF method and captures the non-linearity in the latent space. Finally, I conducted extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset and benchmarked the performance of NCF on the expert recommendation task. Empirically, the recommendation in SO using NCF indicated that the inner-product of latent features of questions and experts with different weights offers better performance.
